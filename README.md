# Recycle Can
Recycle Can is a three front project that strives to provide Canadians with approved locations to dispose of potentially hazardous household waste such as electronics, batteries, and paint. This project will do this in two ways, through a website and iOS application. 

The Google Maps API will be the primary vehicle used to display the locations of recycling centers across Canada. The databases for the recycling locations have been independently acquired through many sources, mostly from separate provincial and municipal government-run websites.

For better and easier navigational tools, the Recycle Can iOS app uses Apple's native MapKit API for deeper functionality and it's repository is also availible on GitHub.

The AutoSelectJS folder contains a neat tool that helps translate Alberta Township System (ATS) address into coordinates.

Note: Recycling locations are constantly being updated and support may be incomplete, particularly for the northern territories. We try our best to constantly update locations and please contact us if there is an issue.

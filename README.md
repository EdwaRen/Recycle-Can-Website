# Recycle_Can_Website
The entire webpage can be accessible via www.recyclecan.ca

This was the original design behind the Recycle Can project, a simple website that provides users with the nearest recycling center. Created mostly using Javascript but considerable effort was put also into processing the database in Excel using Visual Basic. For a version with more functionality, see the iOS project under the same name to access even more features under the same database.

Earlier commits of this repository may refer to this project as "Recycle Ontario", which was the name of this website previously before nationwide support was added.

Happy Recycling!

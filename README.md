# Recycle Can
Recycle Can is a three front project that strives to provide Canadians with approved locations to dispose of potentially hazardous household waste such as electronics, batteries, and paint. This project will do this in three ways, through a website, android application, and iOS application. 

The Google Maps API will be the primary vehicle used to display the locations of recycling centers across Canada. The databases for the recycling locations have been independently acquired through many sources, mostly from separate provincial and municipal government-run websites.
